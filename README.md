# Algotrasoft Community
This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

This project focuses on showcasing the core features of Next.js to demonstrate functionality and usability. On the event page, users can view recent events organized by the Algotrasoft community. The relevant page is generated by the server with a 1-hour lifetime and is updated with the latest information, serving to the client side with SSG rendering. Additionally, the project aims to illustrate compatibility with React and utilize context-specific features. On the homepage, users can find a wealth of information about the community and its activities. Next.js features are optimized for specific cases, such as handling large images. The live project has been deployed using Vercel.
